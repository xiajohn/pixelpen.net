## The Ultimate Meats to Grill

Let's start with the basics: the meat. While burgers and hot dogs are classic options, why not switch things up and try something new? Here are some of the ultimate meats to grill:

### Steak

A perfectly grilled steak is a thing of beauty. Whether you prefer a classic ribeye or a lean sirloin, there's nothing quite like a charred and juicy cut of beef. For the best results, season your steaks generously with salt and pepper before grilling, and make sure your grill is hot enough to get a good sear.

### Chicken

Chicken is a versatile meat that can take on a variety of flavors. Consider marinating your chicken in a flavorful sauce or spice rub before grilling to infuse it with maximum flavor. And don't forget to use a meat thermometer to make sure your chicken is cooked to a safe temperature.

### Pork

From pork chops to baby back ribs, pork is a great option for the grill. To get the most flavor out of your pork, try brining it overnight before grilling. And don't be afraid to experiment with different barbecue sauces or dry rubs to find the perfect flavor profile.

## Vegetables on the Grill

Grilling isn't just for meat-eaters. Vegetables can add a burst of flavor and color to any outdoor meal. Here are some of the best vegetables to grill:

### Corn on the cob

Grilled corn on the cob is a summertime classic. Simply brush your corn with a little butter or olive oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and grill until it's slightly charred. You can also experiment with different seasonings and toppings, like lime juice, chili powder, or Parmesan cheese.

### Portobello mushrooms

Portobello mushrooms are a flavorful and meaty vegetarian option. Brush them with a little balsamic vinegar or soy sauce and grill until they're tender and slightly charred.

### Bell peppers

Grilled bell peppers are sweet, smoky, and versatile. Cut your peppers into large slices or quarters, brush with a little oil, and grill until they're slightly softened and charred. You can serve them as a side dish or use them as a topping for burgers or sandwiches.

## Grilled Desserts

Who says grilling is just for savory dishes? Desserts can be grilled too! Here are some delicious grilled dessert ideas:

### Grilled peaches

Grilling peaches brings out their natural sweetness and adds a smoky depth of flavor. Simply halve your peaches and brush them with a little honey or brown sugar before grilling. Serve them with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for a delicious summer treat.

### Grilled pineapple

Grilled pineapple is another summertime favorite. Cut your pineapple into spears or rings, brush with a little rum or brown sugar, and grill until it's slightly caramelized. You can eat it as is or serve it over ice cream or pound cake for a tropical dessert.

## Conclusion

Now that you know what to grill, it's time to fire up the grill and get cooking! Whether you're a meat-eater or a vegetarian, there are plenty of options to choose from. Don't be afraid to experiment with different seasonings, marinades, and cooking techniques to find your perfect grill game. And remember, grilling is all about having fun and enjoying delicious food in the great outdoors. Happy grilling!
