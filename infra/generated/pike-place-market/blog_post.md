Pike Place Market has a rich history that dates back over a century. It was founded in 1907 by a group of farmers who wanted to sell their produce directly to the public, rather than going through a middleman. The market quickly became popular with both locals and tourists, and by the 1920s, it had expanded to include fishmongers, florists, and other vendors.

In the 1960s, the market was in danger of being demolished to make way for a new highway. However, a group of activists fought to save the market, and in 1971, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. Today, Pike Place Market is a thriving hub of activity and a must-visit destination for anyone visiting Seattle.
