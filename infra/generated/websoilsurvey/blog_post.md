## What is Web Soil Survey?

If you've never ventured into the realm of soil science, fear not - WSS is designed to be user-friendly and accessible to all. A web-based platform, it allows users to access a variety of information about soils in a given area, from their chemical and physical properties to their suitability for different uses and their vulnerability to erosion and flooding. Using a range of tools and features, users can input their location, select from a range of reports and maps, and generate customized reports that meet their specific needs. What's more, this information is constantly updated as new data becomes available, ensuring that users have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information possible.

## Who can benefit from Web Soil Survey?

The short answer is: anyone who cares about the health and productivity of the land. This includes farmers, ranchers, foresters, urban planners, soil scientists, educators, and more. Here are just a few examples of how WSS can be used to support effective decision-making:

**Farmers and ranchers**

If you're a farmer or rancher, you know that soil quality is essential to the success of your crops and livestock. By accessing data on soil texture, depth, drainage, and other characteristics, you can make informed decisions about what crops to plant and how best to manage your land. WSS can also help you identify areas of your land that are particularly vulnerable to erosion or nutrient loss, allowing you to take proactive steps to protect those areas.

**Conservationists and land managers**

Protecting and preserving our natural resources is an essential goal of land management and conservation efforts. WSS can help in this regard by providing data on soil types and properties, as well as information on the unique ecosystems that are found in a given area. With this information, conservationists and land managers can make informed decisions about how best to protect and restore habitats, prevent erosion, and promote sustainable land use practices.

**Urban planners and developers**

The health of our soil isn't just important for rural areas - it's also essential for the health and well-being of our cities and towns. By using WSS to access data on soil properties and urban development, urban planners and developers can make informed decisions about where to build and how to design infrastructure. They can also identify areas that are prone to flooding or other environmental hazards, allowing them to take proactive steps to mitigate those risks.

## How to use Web Soil Survey

Ready to start digging into the data? Here's a step-by-step guide to using WSS:

1. Start by visiting the [Web Soil Survey website](https://websoilsurvey.sc.egov.usda.gov/App/HomePage.htm) and selecting your location using the interactive map.
2. Next, choose the type of report you want to generate - for example, you might want to see a map of soil properties, or a list of soils that are suitable for a particular kind of plant.
3. Customize your report by selecting the specific data you want to see - for example, you might want to focus on data related to soil erosion or water-holding capacity.
4. Review your report, and use the information to make informed decisions about land use and management.

## Conclusion

Soil may not always be top of mind when we think about the natural world - but it should be. It's the foundation upon which all life relies, and its health and productivity are essential to our collective well-being. Web Soil Survey offers a powerful tool for accessing the data and information we need to make informed decisions about how best to manage and protect our land. Whether you're a farmer, a conservationist, an urban planner, or just someone who cares about the earth beneath your feet, WSS is a resource that's well worth exploring. So roll up your sleeves, grab a shovel, and start digging into the data!
