In the 19th century, tennis became a popular sport among the upper class, and the first tennis tournament was held at Wimbledon in 1877.

Tennis is a game that is played on a court with a net in the middle. The object of the game is to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's court without them being able to return it. The game can be played with two or four players and can be played as singles or doubles.

There are several rules that players must follow when playing tennis. The ball must be served from behind the baseline, and it must land in the opposite service box. If the ball hits the net but still lands in the service box, the player gets another chance to serve. If the ball hits the net and lands outside the service box, it is a fault, and the player loses a point.
