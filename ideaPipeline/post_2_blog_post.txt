The penalty Seagate will pay for shipping hard drives to Huawei could set a precedent for other companies doing business with the Chinese tech giant.

The U.S. Department of Commerce has fined Seagate Technologies Inc. $1.2 million for shipping hard drives to Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that has been blacklisted by the U.S. government.

This is the first time a company has been fined for doing business with Huawei, and it could set a precedent for other companies that are doing business with the Chinese tech giant.

The Department of Commerce said that Seagate shipped hard drives to Huawei between September 2017 and March 2018, after Huawei had been added to the Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List.

The Entity List is a list of companies that the U.S. government believes are a risk to national security, and it is illegal to ship products to companies on the list without a license from the Department of Commerce.

Seagate did not apply for a license to ship products to Huawei, and the Department of Commerce said that the company knew that it needed a license.

In addition to the fine, Seagate has agreed to a five-year compliance plan that will require the company to get a license from the Department of Commerce before it ships products to Huawei.

The penalty Seagate is paying could set a precedent for other companies doing business with Huawei.
