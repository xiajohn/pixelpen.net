Jake Gyllenhaal has played several roles of US service members in movies, and he recently spoke about why he loves taking on these characters. In an interview, Gyllenhaal said that he feels a responsibility to tell the stories of those who serve our country.

"I take a lot of pride in playing these roles," Gyllenhaal said. "I feel like it's my duty, especially as someone who's not from a military family, to try and understand and portray the experience of those who do serve."

Gyllenhaal said that he's always been fascinated by the military, and that's what led him to take on roles like Captain Fantastic in "Jarhead" and Lieutenant Colby Stevens in "Southpaw."

"I think there's something incredibly heroic about the military," Gyllenhaal said. "The selflessness, the sacrifice, the courage."

Gyllenhaal said that he hopes his work can help people understand and appreciate the military more.

"I think it's important for people to see the human side of the military," Gyllenhaal said. "To see the men and women who serve, and what they go through."
