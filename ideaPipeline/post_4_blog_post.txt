Love Is Blind is one of the most popular reality TV shows of 2020, and fans of the show have been eagerly awaiting the release of the after-show, "Love Is Blind: The Podcast". But now, some fans are petitioning to have Nick Lachey and his wife Vanessa removed as co-hosts of the podcast. This has caused a lot of controversy, as many people feel that Nick and Vanessa's presence on the show would be a distraction from the content of the podcast.

The petition was started by a fan of the show, who believes that Nick and Vanessa's presence on the podcast would be a "distraction" from the content of the podcast. The fan argued that Nick and Vanessa's celebrity status would take away from the show's focus on the contestants and their relationships, and that they would be more of a "celebrity sideshow" than a helpful addition to the show. The petition has since gained a lot of traction, with over 8,000 people signing it.

On the other hand, some fans of the show feel that Nick and Vanessa would be a great addition to the podcast. They argue that Nick and Vanessa have a unique perspective on relationships, having been married for over 15 years, and that their presence on the podcast would be beneficial to the show. They also point out that Nick and Vanessa have a lot of experience in the entertainment industry, which could be a valuable asset to the podcast.

Ultimately, the decision to have Nick and Vanessa co-host the podcast is up to the show's producers. While the petition has certainly caused a lot of controversy, it remains to be seen whether or not Nick and Vanessa will be invited to co-host the podcast. In the meantime, fans of the show will just have to wait and see what happens.
