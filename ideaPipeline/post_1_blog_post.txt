When Love Is Blind debuted on Netflix, it was an instant hit. The show followed a group of men and women who were looking for love in a unique way: by dating without ever seeing each other.

The show was a hit with viewers, but some fans are now calling for Nick and Vanessa Lachey's removal, accusing the show of mistreating its contestants.

There have been a number of allegations made against the show, including that the contestants were not given enough time to get to know each other, that they were not allowed to leave the house they were filming in, and that they were not given any privacy.

Nick and Vanessa Lachey have denied these allegations, but some fans are still calling for them to be removed from the show.
