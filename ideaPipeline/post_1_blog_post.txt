1.6 billion

There is no doubt that the 2020 election was rife with allegations of voter fraud and election irregularities. Smartmatic, one of the companies that provides voting technology, has been caught up in the controversy. Now, it is suing Fox News for $1.6 billion, claiming that the network engaged in a "disinformation campaign" against the company.

In a statement, Smartmatic said that Fox News' coverage of the election "was riddled with false and misleading statements" about the company and its technology. The suit specifically cites three segments that aired on the network in November and December, in which guests made a number of unsubstantiated claims about Smartmatic's involvement in voter fraud.

"This lawsuit is not about politics," said Smartmatic CEO Antonio Mugica. "It is about holding the press accountable for publishing false statements about Smartmatic."

Mugica added that Fox News' coverage "caused irreparable damage" to the company's reputation and that it is seeking "to restore our good name and to set the record straight."

Fox News has not yet commented on the lawsuit.
